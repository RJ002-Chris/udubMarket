        <p>
            &emsp; At the end of the school year, college students often find themselves moving out of their apartments and dorms. 
            During this time, students try to pack all there stuff to bring back or move to their new place, but oftenly, 
            students will look to get rid of their old belongings or try to sell them. These students go out and search for people 
            they can off load their stuff to, such as friends, class-mates, underclassmen moving in, etc. This website looks to help
            provide students with an online markertplace where students can effectively find buyers and sellers for their belongings,
            a place where there is consistency in the product details and easier to browse and organize the items by type of product.
            This will greatly help students moving in or out of their apartments and dorms and make the process faster and easier. 
            We aim to relieve students of any more stress while giving them more time to do other things such as studying or project work.
